🇮🇳 Bharat 360 - The Spirit of India

"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" — One World, One Family

Bharat 360 is a conceptual web platform designed to showcase India's rising "Soft Power" on the global stage. Aligned with the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, this project envisions a unified "SuperApp" that connects the world to India's spiritual heritage, royal history, culinary diversity, and cutting-edge technological achievements.

🌟 Vision

In the 21st century, influence is not just about economic or military might—it's about the ability to attract and inspire. This project highlights India's unique blend of ancient wisdom (Yoga, Ayurveda) and modern prowess (Space Tech, Digital Infra), proposing a digital gateway for the world to experience the true essence of Bharat.

🚀 How to Run

This project is built as a Single File Application. No complex build steps or node modules are required.

Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

Enjoy the experience! Note: An internet connection is required to load the images, Tailwind CSS, and Icons from CDNs.

📂 File Structure

The entire application logic is contained within one file for portability:

HTML: Structure and layout.

CSS (<style>): Custom animations (Kathputli, Fade-ins) and overrides.

JS (<script>): Game loops, Quiz logic, and UI interactions.

🎨 Design Philosophy

Color Palette: Inspired by the Tricolor (Saffron, White, Green) and the deep blues of the Ashoka Chakra.

Typography: Uses 'Playfair Display' for headers to evoke heritage and elegance, and 'Inter' for body text to ensure modern readability.

Accessibility: Semantic tags and high-contrast text ensure the site is accessible.
